#### 2. API Cleanup & Security
- **❌ Removed dangerous endpoints**:
  - `/api/admin/instant-access` (security vulnerability)
  - `/api/auth/*` (unused regular user auth)
  - `/api/admin/users` (not needed)
  - `/api/admin/overview` (duplicate functionality)

- **✅ Kept essential endpoints**:
  - `/api/admin/auth/*` - Admin authentication
  - `/api/admin/teams` - Team management  
  - `/api/admin/config` - Contest configuration
  - `/api/admin/monitor` - Real-time monitoring
  - `/api/quiz` - Quiz system
  - `/api/voting` - Voting system
  - `/api/scoreboard` - Results

#### 3. Database Connection Optimization
- Enhanced `src/lib/database.ts` with:
  - Connection pooling (20 max, 2 min connections)
  - Error handling and query logging
  - Transaction support
  - Health checks
  - Graceful shutdown

#### 4. Security Improvements

## 🛠️ Development & Maintenance

### Integration Steps

#### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. **Create PostgreSQL database**
2. **Run the optimized schema**:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database < database/optimized-schema.sql
   ```
3. **Update .env.local**:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
   JWT_SECRET="your-secure-32-character-secret"
   ```

#### Phase 2: Enable Real Data
1. **Test database connection**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Check console for database connection logs
   ```
2. **Admin login** (default credentials):
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - **⚠️ CHANGE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY**

#### Phase 3: Production Ready
1. **Security**: Update admin password and JWT secret
2. **Performance**: Monitor database query performance
3. **Real-time**: Enable WebSocket connections for live updates
4. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking and performance monitoring

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Clean expired admin sessions (automated)
- Archive old admin logs (monthly recommended)
- Monitor database performance and connection health
- Update JWT secrets (quarterly recommended)
- Review admin permissions and activity

### Monitoring
- Database connection health via `/api/health`
- API response times and error rates
- Admin activity patterns and security events
- System resource usage and performance metrics

### Scaling Considerations
For large competitions (1000+ teams):
- Implement Redis for session storage
- Add CDN for static assets
- Configure read replicas for database
- Implement rate limiting per team
- Set up load testing and monitoring

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format and SSL settings
   - Check database accessibility from deployment platform
   - Ensure connection pool settings are appropriate

2. **Admin Login Issues**
   - Verify admin user exists in database
   - Check JWT_SECRET configuration
   - Review admin session table for conflicts

3. **Build Failures**
   - Check TypeScript errors in build output
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review environment variables

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Local development
npm run dev

# Build locally
npm run build

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls

# View deployment logs
